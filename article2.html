                If there is one thing that makes gaming sessions complete (well other than the dice, or the character sheets,
                or the terrible luck and amazing luck of the dice, you get the idea) its the soda that is being brought to the table.
                Of course we all like top 10 lists, so might as well do one for the best sodas you can bring to the gaming table.
                Now I will say that this top 10 list is based on my own preferences of sodas, and I know that I have different tasts
                than most. Though I will mention sodas that I don't personally like but my party does. Without furhter ado, let's hop
                into the top 10 list of best sodas you can bring to the table.

            <h3 class="title">10) Dr. Pepper</h3>
            <p>
                Personally, I Find Dr. Pepper to be quite terrible, tasting like medicine more than a soda. However, many members
                of my party absolutly love Dr. Pepper. For what reason I do not know, but you got to please everyone, and Dr. Pepper
                is just one of those things to get for the odd balls in your party. Diet Dr. Pepper is even worse, of course, diet anything
                is just terrible, and I am only mentioning it for those who beleive otherwise.

            <h3 class="title">9) Root Beer</h3>
            <p>
                I also do not particulary enjoy root beer. But I know most people do enjoy the flavor. While I do enjoy other types of "beer" soda
                like ginerale and apple beer, I'm just not particulary fond of root beer. Root Beer can be pretty fun when you mix it with vanilla
                ice cream to make root beer floats. Though I'm the kind of person who would rather take the ice cream by itself (what can I say, I like vanilla
                ice cream).

            <h3 class="title">8) Coke & Pepsi</h3>
            <p>
                I'm just going to lump together Coke and Pepsi, because the practically taste the same. Some might find that blasphamous, but I don't really like
                either of them anyway. However, as previously mentioned, you can't really have a gamming session without coke (or pepsi). I am really the exception
                to the rule on coke I suppose, and everyone else I game with enjoy it. Oh well, that's why it made the list. Even if I am not personally a fan of
                coke and pepsi, it is an essential of gamming sessions. You can't go wrong with coke at parties either. I suppose it is a stapple of American culture.

            <h3 class="title">7) Fruit Flavors</h3>
            <p>
                Whether it be Fanta, grape soda, or some other fruit based flavor of soda, they are all great choices for gamming. Especially if you are brining sodas
                for gamming groups with younger people, or you wish to bring soda to satiate the children at the house you are gamming at, if nothing else than to keep
                them at bay from disrupting your session. Now that's not to say that fruit flavored sodas are bad, in fact, I quite like them myself, but they are not
                neccessarily my favorite. They are great to bring when you wish to keep the littles occupied, but don't want to feel left out.

        <div class="">
            <h3 class="title">6) Ginger Ale</h3>
            <p>
                I've always really liked Ginger Ale. Though perhaps not as much as other types of sodas, mainly for me because of some of the less than fun memories I
                have tied to the soda. My mother used it when we were ill with the stomach flu to calm our digestive systems. While it certainly did the trick, I still
                actually just like the flavor of soda. While perhaps an unusual choice to bring to a gamming session, it is still a valid choice that should be considered.
                At least try bringing it to the table once in a while, it could be a nice change of pace.

            <h3 class="title">5) Hawaiian Punch</h3>
            <p>
                Hawaiian Punch is something that I don't see often, and I know that usually its the children wanting this "soda". However, I do find that it is quite
                good. If nothing else, its another option to keep the kids busy and away from the gamming table. However, while there is the classic red punch flavor,
                there are quite a few other flavors out there that are fun to try and are also tasty. 
            </p>

        <div class="">
            <h3 class="title">4) Lemonade</h3>
            <p>
                While I suppose its probably just as unhealthy as any other kind of soda, when I have lemondade its usually becuase I want something that isn't a
                soda. Or at least not unhealthy as normal soda. Plus, lemondade is something that I enjoy to drink a lot. Usually the stuff that come in the cans
                isn't very good, but if you can make your own fresh lemonade (or buy it), or I suppose even any kind of freshly squeezed drink, you should totally go for it.
                While certainly not a traditional choice, it is certainly a treat to bring to the table.

            <h3 class="title">3) Spirte & 7-Up</h3>
            <p>
                Sprite, and I suppose 7-Up to a lesser extent, hold a special place in my heart. When I was little I was very picky I suppose, and I didn't like the sodas
                that my Dad let me try. That was until I got to try Sprite. From there it was the first soda that I ever actually enjoyed the flavor of. Perhaps that was
                actually a bad thing in retrospect, considered that soda is unhealthy. But who really cares, when it comes to gamming, you are using the time to relax
                and have fun with your buddies. A think Spite should be something considered be taken to any gamming session. It is also a solid choice of soda to satisfy
                the children.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="">
            <h3 class="title">2) Mountain Dew</h3>
            <p>
                Mountain Dew is by far the best soda out there. You can't have a gamming session without it. This is by far the essential soda that any gamming session needs.
                I know that some are not fans of Mountain Dew, but I don't think they know what they are talking about. If I'm going to be getting soda, the first thing I 
                always look to see is if they have Pepsi products, because I want Mountain Dew. Unfortunatly, most places out where I live have Coke products, so I don't get
                to have Mountain Dew all that much when I go out to eat. That is why we make sure to really stock up on it when gamming. You can never have enough of the stuff
                when you are at the table.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="">
            <h3 class="title">1) Mountain Dew Code Red & Live Wire</h3>
            <p>
                If there is anything better than Mountain Dew, its more Mountain Dew, but in crazy awesome flavors. While my favorite Mountain Dew flavor is probably Baha Blast,
                you can only actually get that flavor from Taco Bell, so it is not really fisable to get it for a gamming session. Unless you are getting Taco Bell for everyone I
                suppose. Which is an option I suppose. The other best non classic flavors to pick from are Code Red and Live Wire. Live Wire being an orange soda version of Mountain
                Dew, and Code Red being some sort of red fruit (Not sure which). Reguardless, when you want to switch things up from the normal Mountain Dew, you go for these
                special flavors.
