                Fast Food is certinaly not healthy, but who really cares when there are so many options out there in terms of fast
                food places you can eat with. Fast Food places have become a stapple of American culture, and with so many choices
                it is time that I give a breakdown of some of the best choices out there, depending on what you are in the mood for,
                whether it be a burger, a taco, or something else. If you want my opinion on the best places to go for fast food,
                this article is for you.

        <h3 class="title">Best Burger</h3>
        <p>
            If you are looking for a burger, the following are some of the best places to get your burgers from.
            While there are many many burger place choices. Some stand out above the rest in terms of the best
            fast food burgers. Burgers are as much a stapple of American culture as fast food in general is. It is
            to be an American to get a Burger. I'm getting hungry just thinking about the juicy burger.
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Burger King</h4>
        <p>
            I mean, for a place that proclaims the burger in their name, you got to mention Burger King in the list
            of best contending burgers. But all joking aside, Burger King make some pretty mean burgers. The
            Whopper is a good choice, but their Bacon King is also pretty good. Burger King also have some of the
            better fries as it comes to fast food places out there. I find them much better than the fries from other
            burger fast food places, that is for sure. I do happen to go the Burger King on a fairly regular basis,
            well at least I did, before the whole Coronavirus crazy mess happened. Well, I suppose it's something
            to look forward to once the lockdowns are lifted.
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Wendy's</h4>
        <p>
            Wendy's is also a good choice in terms of burgers. While the best reason to come here are their 4 for 4's and biggy bags
            their Baconators are pretty good. Wendy's is a solid choice for when you want a vareity of things, whether it be chicken
            nuggets, or something else. Also, I really love going to Wendy's for their vannilla frosties. I'm a sucker for them, and
            I really love to go to Wendy's just for their frosties. But to be fair, I do cycle between here and Burger King when
            going out to eat on a regular basis.
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">In-N-Out</h4>
        <p>
            If you want the best bang for your buck, by far the best burger place has got to be In-N-Out. They have very cheap, large
            and the most delicious burgers out there. Though everyone else knows it too, so you will often have to wade through long
            lines waiting your turn to get your food when you come here. If there was one closer to where I live, I would come here
            a lot more regularly. The food also tends to take longer than at other fast food places, but the burgers are much fresher
            and they have very good fries. The only down side comming here, is they don't have much in the way of vareity and options.
            You pretty much have a burger and fries, and that is it. Though if you are comming just for a burger, than you will be
            just fine.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title">Best Sandwhiches</h3>
        <p>
            If you are looking for a sandwhich, the following are some of the best places to grab a sandwhich.
            Sandwhiches have gotten more expensive than they used to, but it is always fun getting the foot long sandwhich. 
            Or other types of sandwhiches.
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Subway</h4>
        <p>
            You can't really mention sandwhiches without mentioning subway. While it is true that they have been heavily waining in
            popularity over the years, they still make some pretty good sandwhiches. It is still fun to watch and customize your sandwhiches
            with your own toppings and condements. Making your own sandwhich your way is part of the fun of comming here. Subway is the classic
            fast food sandwhich shop. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Firehouse Sub</h4>
        <p>
            While subway is good, a much better alternative with pretty much the same menu and style is Firehouse Sub. While I don't remember
            the process being quite as customizable as subway (I could be misremebering) their sandwhichs are by far better in terms of quality.
            They also have the superior meat ball sub. A very tasty alternative to subway.
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Chick-Fil-a</h4>
        <p>
            Say what you will about their politics, but Chick-Fil-a have some pretty mean chicken sandwhiches. I also really
            enjoy their waffle fries. Though to be honest, I love Chick-Fil-a's breakfast food more than anything else. Their
            breakfast hashbrowns and egg and cheese sandwhiches are just great to eat. Chick-Fil-a in general just have a 
            sort of fresh taste to their food, that other fast food places don't really have. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="title">Best Mexican Food</h3>
        <p>
            Mexican fast food is certainly a nice change of pace from your all-american fast food places that have been
            previously mentioned. However, Mexican food is just as good as American food, if not better in many cases. Taco's are probably
            being adopted as a statle of the American diet as much as the burger is. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="subtitle">Taco Bell</h4>
        <p>
            In terms of purely fast food taco places, Taco Bell is by far the best. Other places like Dell Taco, or Taco Time are just
            terrible by comparison. Taco Bell may have some of the greasiest tacos but they are certainly superior in taste. I would
            say that Taco Bell is a stapple of the fast food diet, and is one of the places rotated between when I get fast food on a 
            regular basis. Taco Bell has many choices other than Tacos, and it is just a tasty menu, from Mexican pizzas, to burritos, and
            everything else on their menu.
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Costa Vida</h4>
        <p>
            While not purely a fast food place, Costa Vida is a good place to get your Mexican Food when you aren't going to a fancy resteraunt. 
            While Some prefer Cafe Rio over Costa Vida, I think both are equally as good. I just have gone to Costa Vida more. Reguardless, both
            are great choices to get your Mexican Food fix when you want something with better quality than Taco Bell. It has some really
            tasty mexican food that you can take on the go pretty easily.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title">Best Pizza</h3>
        <p>
            Pizza is probably a major food group that needs to be eaten regularly. While there are many pizza places out there (and some definatly
            not very good), there are also many decent and good pizza places out there. While there is a lot of vareity in fast food pizza out there
            these are what I deem to be the best fast food pizza out there.
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Papa Johns</h4>
        <p>
            By far the best fast food pizza is Papa Johns. The quality of their pizza far outpaces the competition by a long shot in terms of their
            pizza. The pizza from Papa Johns just taste so much better, not like the assembly like mass produced garbage that you often get from the other
            fast food pizza places. If you are looking for quality fast food pizza, Papa Johns is your place.
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Little Ceasers</h4>
        <p>
            While I relize that Little Ceasers pizza is increadibly cheap, especially that crazy bread, I will say that Little Ceaser's is my one of
            my favorite places to get pizza from. Especially their crazy bread. The pizza here is fairly decent, though it is hard to eat in mass
            quantities, and on a regular basis. The cheap price of the pizza is a nice added bonus. Perhaps the reason I love Little Ceasers over
            other pizza places is the nostalgia I feel for it. After all, it was where my Mom would take us to get pizza if she was tight on money but
            wanted to treat us.
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Dominos</h4>
        <p>
            While their actual Pizza is subpar at best, everything else they offer, from sandwhiches, pasta, bread bites, bread sticks, etc. make Dominos
            a decent fast food pizza place to order from. I really don't care for their actual pizza, but they are decent enough with everything else. 
            I enjoy their bread bites, and their sandwhiches are actually pretty good.
        </p>

        <h3 class="title">Everything Else worth Mentioning</h3>
        <p>
            While I hit on the major bases for fast food, like Pizza and Burgers, there are still a few other places worth mentioning in terms of fast
            food that are just amazing. 
        </p>

        <h4 class="subtitle">Panda Express</h4>
        <p>
            I am a pretty big fan of Panda Express, especially since I don't get to come here very often. However, Panda Express is a place to when
            you want to get really filled up. While there are many choices, by far my favorite here is to get their orange chicken, choi mein noodles,
            and their egg rolls. While there is a little something for everyone here, it is one of the best chineese fast food places around.
